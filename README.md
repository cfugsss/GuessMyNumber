# GuessMyNumber
Basic guess the number game. One of my first javascript, html, css projects.

# Description 

In this project I learned how to style the html using css (following a html and css course) and add functionality like the play again button
and user input box. Also implemented a score and highscore tracker which makes the game a little more enjoyable. Overall happy with the 
outcome for one of my first projects.
